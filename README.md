# OCAMicro
Source code repository of the OCAMicro code

This is the source code which is used for different demo's performed by the OCA Alliance member companies on different trade shows. 

A quick overview of the code:

- OCAMicro/OCAMicro/Src/common/OCALite : This directory structure contains all code which actually implements the AES70 protocol with objects. 
- OCAMicro/OCAMicro/Src/app/OCALite : Contains a windows port (with visual studio project), great starting point if you want to understand what's happening in the code.

- OCAMicro/OCAMicro/buildstm.bat : contains the main build entry for Stm32 target (OCAMicro demo boards), make sure you have ARM GCC installed as compiler / make v3.81 / msys



This project does contain other open source software. Thanks for all the great work! Keep it going.
